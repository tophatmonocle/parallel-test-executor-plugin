<div>
    Configure how exclusions and inclusions are formed from the JUnit result XML. The test job 
    receiving the exclusion/inclusion files must be able to handle the format produced by
    the selected mode.
    
    <p>
    <strong>Parallelize on test classes (Java)</strong><br/>
    This mode represents the original parallel test executor behavior.
    Each exclusion/inclusion generates two lines by replacing "." with "/" in the fully qualified test
    class name and appending ".java" to one line and ".class" to the second line.

    <p>
    <strong>Parallelize on test case name (Generic)</strong><br/>
    Each exclusion/inclusion generates one line consisting of the test case name only. This is useful
    where a tool produces JUnit result XML containing unique test case names without any class prefix. 
    
    <p>
    <strong>Parallelize on class and test case name (Generic)</strong><br/>
    Each exclusion/inclusion generates one line consisting of the class and test case name on a
    className.testName format.
